In order to make this program work you have to attach the free java Text2Spech jar file to the project's Referenced Libraries

**A simple Text to speech editor created for my summer semester of 2018  in Software Development II. Created using Java. Implemented using the MVC model. This repo also contains all the tests I performed in the program to solify that it performs correct. For more info read the comments and contact me.**
